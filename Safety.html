        <p>For the experimentation part we were hosted by the TBI, a laboratory working in the biotechnology field. Nathalie Doubrovine is the head of the safety department and the person in charge of risk prevention. Her role is to ensure that the various safety rules are respected so the employees can work safely. Before starting web lab activities, we attended to two training courses: one with Nathalie Doubrovine herself on a zoom meeting, and the other one on the lab intranet, as a formation through the software NEO. We learned about multiple risks and took a test to validate our knowledge.</p>
        <p><strong>Legislation and French Labor Law</strong></p>
        <p>We are working in a French engineering school (INSA Toulouse), thus we have to respect the French national regulations about working conditions and manipulation of GMOs. As we work with microorganisms, we are concerned by the regulation on workers protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No. 94-352 of 4 May 1994). It also includes human endoparasites which may cause infections, allergies or toxicity. This Decree is the French transposition of Directive 90/679/EEC and is also transcribed in the Labor Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5). This Decree of 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that must be followed in research laboratories, where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens. We must obey the rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (Decree No. 82-453). This decree refers to the Labor Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.</p>
        <p><strong>Training</strong></p>
        <p>Two members of our team have attended an autoclave training to allow us to sterilize our equipment by ourselves. This training sensitized us to the dangers of explosions and implosions of an autoclave and the safety measures to take to ensure the protection of the operator. A lab coat, heat resistant gloves and glasses are required for the manipulation of the autoclave.</p>
        <p>We also received training in the use of Ethidium bromide and UV light for revealing our gel electrophoreses. There is a specific key-lockable room to handle this solution, where nothing can exit the room once it came into contact with a contaminated object. In this room, lab coat, gloves and glasses are mandatory. This room is equipped with specific bins for the different wastes, such as electrophoresis gels or consumables, to avoid any contamination of the environment.</p>
        <h1 id="safety-in-the-lab">Safety in the lab</h1>
        <p><strong>basic rules</strong></p>
        <p>In all laboratories, some basic safety principles must be applied:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is forbidden to smoke in all rooms.</li>
          <li>It is forbidden to drink and eat in the laboratory rooms.</li>
          <li>It is compulsory to wear a closed cotton lab coat.</li>
          <li>It is compulsory to wear closed shoes and long pants.</li>
          <li>Long hair must be tied back.</li>
          <li>Oral pipetting of any substance is prohibited in any laboratory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also others precautions when working with biological organisms:<br>
          - We need to wash our hands regularly.<br>
          - It is compulsory to wear gloves except for the use of an electric or gas burner.<br>
          - In some cases (UV light, projection risk), it is compulsory to wear protection glasses.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Equipments</strong><br>
          As soon as we manipulate in the lab, we must wear the following personal protective equipments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A conventional lab coat</li>
          <li>Closed with long sleeves</li>
          <li>Closed shoes</li>
          <li>Gloves</li>
          <li>Glasses if needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Materials and Machines</strong></p>
        <p>We must always be vigilant when using certain equipments. There are many risks related to electricity, risk of injuries or improper uses of an equipment.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Centrifuge</li>
          <li>Electrophoresis tank</li>
          <li>Syringe and Blade</li>
          <li>Water-baths</li>
          <li>Ethidium Bromide</li>
          <li>Chemical hood</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Storage</strong><br>
          Three different cupboards are used to separate the different kinds of chemical products: flammable, acids, bases.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Waste</strong><br>
          Different trash containers are available in the lab:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Biological waste (it will be autoclaved before being thrown out)</li>
          <li>Common waste</li>
          <li>Special container for chemicals</li>
          <li>Special container for waste in contact with ethidium bromide</li>
          <li>Biological safety cabinets</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To work in a sterile area and thus avoid external contaminations by unwanted microorganisms, we used biological safety cabinets (FASTER Ultrasafe). These BSCs are cleaned with ethanol before and after each manipulation, and are sterilized by UV light every night. A maintenance control is done each year. The last control was executed on December 5th 2019.</p>
        <p><strong>External risks</strong><br>
          TBI is concerned by many different types of hazards due to its wide spectrum of scientific activities. One hazard category includes risks that are not directly linked to the TBI research activity such as working conditions (noise, thermal atmosphere,Heatwave during summer, etc.), electrical hazards, working on computer screens, falling, and so on. The main hazard categories concern the substances handled for research purposes such as class 1 microorganisms (GMO or not), urban wastewaters, chemical products including CMRs, or cryogenic fluids to name a few. A secondary main hazard category relates to equipment and pilot plants with specific risks such as equipment using pressurized liquids, gases or steam (autoclaves), instruments generating non-ionizing radiations (Laser, UV lights) and electromagnetic radiation (RMN).

        <h1 id="safety-during-covid-19"><strong>Safety during Covid-19</strong></h1>
        <p>This year with the particular context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been authorized to manipulate in the laboratory provided that we follow some additional safety rules. Wearing a mask is mandatory as well as washing our hands when entering or leaving the building or any room. Each member of the team was given his own equipment (pipette, lab coat…) and we had to be careful not to mix our equipment between us. Also, when we had tasks such as meetings, benchling designs or more generally any dry lab task that does not need to be in the laboratory, teleworking from home is highly recommended.</p>
        <p>These rules have evolved over time according to the evolution of the pandemic in France. For instance, at the beginning we had to wear a mask in any situations. But after a few weeks, we were allowed to take it off when working alone in a well-ventilated room, provided that we always clean our working space afterwards with a virucide.</p>
        <p>This disease has affected our project, particularly in terms of the handling areas, which were restricted. Some rooms and equipment were inaccessible or required a certain person to perform the task. In addition, our supervisors could not be present in the laboratory all day long, they had to plan their visit and respect the rules of social distancing. Despite all these restrictions, we adapted our way of working in order to make our project progress with the least inconvenience possible.</p>
        <p>[PHOTO] (soit du matériel avec nos noms soit d’une manipulation avec masque)</p>
        <h1 id="safety-for-our-project"><strong>Safety for our project</strong></h1>
        <p>We chose a project with the goal of sending our system to space inside a spacecraft. This means that safety is at the very center of our project, since we cannot afford to send an object that could endanger the lives of the crew on a spacecraft. We have studied the aspects related to the reactor as thoroughly as the “aspects related to sending such a prototype in space with the constraints associated with this environment". In addition, the part concerning GMOs from a nutritional point of view has been dealt with the help of various specialists.</p>
        <p>The safety aspect of our project is present at all stages of the life cycle. We invite you to take a look at the implementation page for more information on the safety aspects of our project in its application in space or on earth.</p>
