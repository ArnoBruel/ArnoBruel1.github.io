        <p><strong>Arno Bruel</strong><br>
          Wiki leader<br>
          Biochemical engineering student at INSA<br>
          He is flawlessly kind and an effortless genius. The kind of person who decides to learn Japanese on his own! In fact, he is really gifted in languages. This is why we decided to ask him to learn html for our iGEM wiki. <br />
          But beware if your grammar is not perfect… He is on the lookout for every mistake!

        <p><strong>Anton Mykhailiuk</strong><br>
          Wet lab leader<br>
          Biotechnology Master student at UPS<br>
          Myka…Miukli… If his name is so difficult to write and pronounce, that's because he's Ukrainian. And he used to be a talented young singer in his country! But the call for biology was too strong and he abandoned his career to become our wet lab leader.<br />
          He can read miles of articles without getting tired of it and loves to show up way too early at the lab. Even though he's now fully committed to biology, he always puts music on when working and starts entertaining us singing in the lab whenever he feels like it.

        <p><strong>Laurène Adam</strong><br>
          Communication leader<br>
          Biotechnology Master student at UPS<br>
          Amusing and inventive… here’s a communication pro! You've never seen someone as efficient as her at taking pictures and posting them on social media. Beware, she might also start a professional director carreer soon! <br />
          She's embracing life and knows how to throw a party (to the great displeasure of her neighbors). Always ready for a good laugh, her cheerfulness would defeat even the greatest hurdles that may stand in our path.

        <p><strong>Solène Frapard</strong><br>
          Human practices leader<br>
          Biochemical engineering student at INSA<br />
          She looks like an angel but don't get fooled by her innocent face! She will defend our project tooth and nail and hold on to every opportunity of making our project shine. Under her diplomatic skills, she's reckless and tenacious. You don't get rid of her easily, that's for sure!<br />
          But her determination and involvment are only equalled by her imagination. She's the one who came up with space as our project theme and managed to convince us against all odds. She's one of a kind...

        <p><strong>Laura Balcells</strong><br />
          Organization leader<br />
          Bioinformatics and systems biology at UPS<br />
          Our trustworthy organization leader who rigorously reported every meeting, every event and every change throughout our progression. She is the definition of an iron fist in a velvet glove: if you mess up something or forget to report your activities, she will notice and push you to fix your mistakes.<br />
          She likes it when it's clean, well structured and complete. But behind this hard shell, lies a hilarious and admirable girl who will always put all her heart in what she's dedicated to.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Eliot Goguet</strong><br />
          Modeling leader<br />
          Biochemical engineering student at INSA<br />
          The funniest guy you'll ever meet, always ready to clown around and have the most fun out of every situation. He loves to disguise and when he's not wearing outrageously hilarious outfits at parties, he loves hanging around topless as it's 'quote' more comfortable this way 'unquote'<br />
          Excentric to say the least, he's one of the most passionate person I've seen around and has had no problems going out of his comfort zone to learn how to model symbiotic and synthetic systems. He's a pretty bad loser though, but his faithfulness and golden heart wouldn't let anyone down for anything.

        <p><strong>Cécilia Brancheriau</strong><br />
          Treasurer<br />
          Biochemical engineering student at INSA<br />
          Our outstanding and beloved treasurer... Starting from scratch and with very little money in the account, she moved heaven and earth to raise funds and give us the best sponsors possible. Battling on all fronts, she sacrficed her free time to ensure the financial prosperity of our project; and her unfailing commitment payed.<br />
          You wouldn't say by her cute face but she's far from being a princess and her humor has nothing to envy to your dad's old jokes. Hang out with her and you'll know you've found a priceless friend.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Pierre Demoux</strong><br />
          Entrepreneurship leader<br />
          Biochemical engineering student at INSA<br />
          Pierre is a curious tall guy who's got an incredible talent at teasing people. A mischevous boy who decided (almost) willingly to develop the Implementation part of our project. His major asset? His deep and soothing voice will undoubtedly bewitch you. Charmed by his French accent, you'll have no choice but to listen to his every word.<br />
          He has two missions and both are capital: make our project feasable and applicable for space travels, and reshape our design to help solve the current issue of vitamin A deficiency on Earth. May the odds be ever in your favor, fellow entrepreneur!
