          Wiki leader<br>

          He is flawlessly kind and an effortless genius. The kind of person who decides to learn Japanese on his own! In fact, he is really gifted in languages. This is why we decided to ask him to learn html for our iGEM wiki. But beware if your grammar is not perfect… He is on the lookout for every mistake!

          Wet lab leader<br>
          Biotechnology Master student at UPS<br>
          Myka…Miukli… If his name is so difficult to write and pronounce, that's because he's Ukrainian. And he was a talented young singer in his country! But the call of duty was too strong and he abandonned is career to become our wet lab leader. He can read miles of articles without getting tired of it.
