        <p>Here is a summary of what we did for our project during the year. We were able to meet in person until March and then we had to quickly adapt to the worldwide situation because of COVID-19. We then switched to online meetings, and we didn’t meet in person until we went back to the lab in June. Even if we were all together in the lab, since our team is made up of less than 10 people, we had to follow many hygiene rules, such as wearing a face mask, keeping a safe distance between us all the time, washing our hands very often…Here is an overview over the accomplishments and the challenges we had to manage during our Project</p>

          <h2 id="cloning">Cloning</h2>
          <h3 id="plasmids">Plasmids</h3>
          <p>Transformation into E. coli stellar of all the plasmids: pFL38, pHR0016, pRS313, pFL36, pRS316, pRS315, pMRI34, pENZ-047.</p>
          <p>Miniprep plasmid control by enzymatic digestion, and verification on agarose gel.</p>
          <p>All the plasmids of the transformation are correct except for T15. So we will do another digestion to another digest of verification.</p>
          <p>This very profile does not meet our expectations and adds up to the pile of unsatisfying digestions. Two hypotheses can be formulated from this observation: either the sequence we have been given is incorrect, or the plasmid we aquired is not the one we asked for (aka pHR0016). Investigations need to be carried out to determine which hypothesis holds.</p>
          <p>pUC19 digestion: SbfI-BamHI, BamHI-EcoRI, SbfI-XmaI, XmaI-EcoRI, SbfI-XbaI, BamHI-SacI, SbfI-SacI, XbaI-BamHI, XmaI-Xbal.</p>
          <p>Gel purification of digested pUC19, and determination concentration.</p>
          <p>Preparation of S. cerevisiae culture for amplifying yeast genome sequences.</p>
          <h3 id="provitamin-a">Provitamin A</h3>
          <p>Miniprep of transformed plasmids.</p>
          <p>PCR from the minipreps in order to obtain our 6 fragments: DPP1, tCYC-Hmg1, pTDH3-tEF1, CrtE-Tadh1, His3, DPP1 down. We verified that we have the correct fragments with an agarose gel, so we redo the PCR in the same conditions.</p>
          <p>We mix both PCR, and we purify it from an agarose gel, the bands on this gel are where we expect them, and we measured the concentration of DNA for each fragment</p>
          <h4 id="rose-and-brazzein">Rose and brazzein</h4>
          <p>PCR from the miniprep to obtain a fragment with LEU2.</p>
          <h3 id="section-36">25/06/2020</h3>
          <p>Meeting with Marie-Pierre Escudie about the ethical matrix and security.</p>

          <p>We participated at the German Meetup, where we presented our team and our poster. We got first place in the poster competition! It was amazing to be able to meet with other teams and learn about their projects.</p>
          <p>[photo german meetup]</p>
          <h2 id="fermentation">Fermentation</h2>
          <p>Preculture of 20mL S. cerevisiae in YNB (60% Ac and 40% EtOH): DPP1, tCYC-Hmg1, pTDH3-tEF1.</p>
          <p>Preparation of the preculture media.</p>
          <p>Culture monitoring: not all culture appears to be growing in all the conditions that we tested, this may be due to a preculture issue.</p>
          <h2 id="cloning">Cloning</h2>
          <p>Purification of 5 out of the 9 pUC19 vectors. And PCR of all the fragments needed for all the cloning’s. Most of them successful.</p>
          <h3 id="provitamin-a">Provitamin A</h3>
          <p>PCR for the three fragments for the two clones, and gel verification. All results are positive, so we follow with the infusion of the three fragments into pUC19. Some clones grew! So, we verified them and most of them seem to have the insert.</p>
          <h3 id="rosebrazzeine-and-provitamin-a">Rose/Brazzeine and Provitamin A</h3>
